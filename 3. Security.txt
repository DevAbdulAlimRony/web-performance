1. Keeping System Up to Date: Update to New Version always.
2. Use HTTPS
3. If you already have HTTPS, then it's important to check it's configured correctly. A badly configured HTTPS server is almost as bad as not having any HTTPS at all - worse in some cases depending on how your browsers displays this.
4. SSL Labs have an excellent free scanning tool where you can type in your website address and it will grade your HTTPS configuration. They even publish a free SSL/TLS Deployment Best Practices document which is kept up to date regularly.
5. There are a number of HTTP security headers you can set to secure your website. There are a number of standard headers, which can switch on various security settings on the browser, restricting and locking down how the user can use your website in the browser.
6. A full Penetration Test (aka Pen Test) by an dedicated security company may be appropriate
