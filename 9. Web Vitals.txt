Web Vitals is an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web.
- Core Web Vitals: Subset of all Web Vitals
- Largest Contentful Paint(LCP): measures loading performance, should occur within 2.5s when page first loading
- Interation to Next Paint(INP): Measures Interactivity, should within 200ms or less
- Cumulative Layout Shift(CLS): Measures Visual Stability, should maintain of 0.1 or less.
- Each of the Core Web Vitals can be measured in JavaScript using standard web APIs. Easiest Way: Use the js web-vitals library

1. Largest Contentful Paint:
   -  How soon after opening a page, the largest content element on the page appears. The fastest, the Better.
   - Elemnts considered: img, image inside an svg, video, bg image, loaded with url()
   - Measure- If Lighthouse and CrUX(PageSpeed Insights) disagree, then CrUX likely provides a more accurate picture of your user experience.
   - 

2. Cumulative Layout Shift:
   - How stable the page layout is once the page starts loading


3. Interaction to Next Paint
   - How long the page remains frozen after user interaction with no visual updates.
